	<h1>The Day They Fell in Love Again!</h1>
	<p>
		<i>"She was an angel and he was just another guy. She was heaven and he was just him. She was fucking beautiful and he looked like every other guy. She had this charm. Her grace was god-given and her face was to die for."</i><br><br>
		This is how he saw their relationship. To him there was nothing special about him that would attract her. Yet she was with him, even though he was an asshole sometimes. He felt like the most lucky guy on this planet. The day after he returned home was Christmas. They had a heated discussion in the morning and things just felt offf. But then they were called to a party...a Christmas party. They went eagerly, longing to see each other and spend time with each other. And so they did. She was joyous and he was elated. She was as smooth as butter with her words and actions while he was big and bulky. They spent time babysitting a pretty angel who brought them close again, who made them fall in love again. They felt like parents to this baby and acted like such. "She would make the best mother", he thought while looking at her affectionately. Her hair was in a high pony while he had his open and spread around all over his face which is probably why the baby was afraid of him. Every minute he spent with her the more his love increased. He wanted her. He wanted to feel her. To touch her. To smell her. But alas the society would not approve of two young birds in love. He was in torment and pain because he could not feel her. He wanted to make his presence known to every cell of her body. He missed her so fucking much. Then they went down and fell in love even harder as they strolled around the appartment while bumping into each other and roasting and having fun like old times. They had a really good time after which they went on a drive and had a blast. She cradled the little angel in her arms who slept peacefully and he massaged her tiny little feet with utmost care while also simultaneously massaging his lover's foot. He was at peace. Finally! He was able to touch her. TO be with her. The conversations they had made his soul calm and relaxed. He could breathe finally and felt like living again. It was ethereal. He was so light that he could have taken her anf flown away into the sky. He was Peter Pan! He remembered how much he loved her before. Thoughts came rushing, closed doors opened, buried stuff was unearthed. All bad things were forgotten and only the good remained. He loved her and thats what mattered to him. To him it was the day they fell in love again. To him she was home.
